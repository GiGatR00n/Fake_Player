Connect fake client to CoD2 or CoD4 server
===========
This scripts are made for connecting a fake client into Call of Duty 2 or Call of Duty 4 server.

You need a valid CD-KEY for this scripts to work.

Usage:

For CoD2 1.3 and CoD4 1.7:

perl fake_player_cod2_1.3.pl SERVER PORT CD-KEY PBGUID

perl fake_player_cod2_1.3.pl 192.168.1.1 28960 12AB-23CD-56EF-78GH 123456789abcdef1234567890abcdefa

For CoD2 1.0 PBGUID is not needed

You can also create and use .bat or .sh files if you wish.

For NON-PB CoD2 1.3 servers, any PBGUID will work, you can use 123456789abcdef1234567890abcdefa
if you want
